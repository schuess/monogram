As you can see, I have included several versions of your monogram. There is a "regular" weight, as based on the concept approved by you, and one "bold" version that's a little heavier. Each come in three iterations: without wings, with wings, and outlined, and then there are three more versions of these six variants, namely a black-on-white, black-on-transparent, and white-on-transparent colorway.
The vector versions, as they are easily editable, stick to black-on-transparent.

In the "Fancified" folder, you'll see an ornate version of your monogram, surrounded by Art Deco curls, and a splash of color. Note that these are raster-only, but they are fairly high resolution. They'd make a great instagram post!
Please let me know if you need any variations on the files provided above, or have any questions about recommended usage.

I know I told you that this monogram is 'mathematically perfect', but that's a bit of a misnomer. My vector-drawing software allows me to see precisely how thick lines are, and how far the distances between them, etc, but ultimately the most important factor is the human eye, which often clashes with mathematics. If you're interested, here's a brief article on the subject: https://typographica.org/on-typography/is-what-i-see-what-i-get-math-and-optics-in-type-design/
